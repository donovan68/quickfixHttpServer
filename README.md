The Financial Information Exchange (FIX) protocol is an industry supported message standard addressing the specific needs of parties conducting electronic securities transactions. QuickFIX/C++ is an open source FIX engine developed in the C++ programming language. This class provides C++ developers with an introduction to the FIX protocol and quickly moves into a thorough discussion and hands-on experience with the QuickFIX/C++ engine’s implementation and use.
Objectives

    To provide a general introduction of the FIX protocol, suitable for developers, business analysts, and managers.

    To prepare C++ developers to fully utilize the functionality of the QuickFIX/C++ engine in their own environment.

    Topics include the benefits and consequences of using QuickFIX/C++, its licensing model, architecture and design, installation and build procedures, and techniques for integrating QuickFIX/C++ with an application.
Prerequisites

Intermediate to advanced C++ programming ability. Attendees should have an understanding of the techniques necessary to write exception-safe and thread-safe code in C++. No prior experience with FIX or financial markets is required.
